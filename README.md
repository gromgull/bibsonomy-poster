Bibsonomy Poster
----------------


This is a very simple Android App for posting bookmarks to http://www.bibsonomy.org/

The bookmarking is done through the "Share" menu from any application 
and is done with a single click. 

No adding of tags is possible, the bookmarks are added with a single "from_android" tag. 

To setup, start the application once and enter your Bibsonomy username and the API key 
from the settings page: 

http://www.bibsonomy.org/settings?seltab=2


It may be nice to have another configuration option for opening the Bibsonomy Mobile Web 
tagging page when clicked, rather than just bookmarking with a single "from_android" tag. 
I am open to pull-requests :) 

The App is also available from the Play Store:
